# OptionData
 Scripts used to scrape and process options chain data from CBOE website.
 Other scripts include will include my analysis and dashboard examples.
 The batch file is for automating with TaskScheduler on Windows. 
 

 The only data I'm making available on GitHub is the  
 hive-partitioned SPX option data. For the example purposes.
